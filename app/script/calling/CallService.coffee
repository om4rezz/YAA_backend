  ###
  Deletes a flow on the backend.

  @note If a call connection with a remote device (participant) ends, we need to delete the flow to this device.

    Sometimes calls to a remote device ended already but the backend state still has active flows to these devices.
    In this case we need to force the deletion of these active flows with the reason "released".

    If we detect on the PeerConnection level, that a remote participant dropped, we can
    delete the flow to them with reason "timeout".

    Possible errors:
    - {"code":404,"message":"the requested flow does not exist","label":"not-found"}
    - {"code":403,"message":"cannot remove active flow","label":"in-use"}

  ###
  Update the SDP of a connection.

  @note Errors can be:
    - {"code":400,"message":"invalid SDP transition requested","label":"bad-sdp"}

    The "bad-sdp" can happen when you send an offer to an offer or if one flow has been already partially negotiated and we try to negotiate for a second flow.
